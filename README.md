# Youtube-Tutorials-Python-GUI-Basics
the code that accompanies my Youtube lessons
We are making a GUI program that converts feet into meters - A calculator

Each lesson we will add to the program and learn more about Tkinter

To use these lessons you ONLY need to have Python installed
I use IDLE for the tutorials - for convenience and most beginners will use IDLE

Tkinter (the GUI module in Python) is pre-packaged with Python
So you will not need any extra modules to do these lessons

Requirements:
Python 2.7  #

# To run on Python 3 the import Tkinter line of code can be edited to import tkinter (lower case t)

Any questions please contact me on raserppsprograms@gmail.com

I appreciate ANY feedback - and would love to know if these lessons are helpful
Also - I am open to lesson requests

Well done for taking the steps to learn about programming!
